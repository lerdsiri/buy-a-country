## Overview

A "make believe" buy-a-country site made as part of the assignment at the coding bootcamp, Integrify Academy, in which users can purchase countries. The following functionalities are featured: 
- search for country by name
- sort by name
- sort by population
- add/remove from cart.

This is a solo project - github automatically added the instructor as a co-contributor who set up the original private repository under Integrify Academy github account for ease of turning in the assignment. The codes were otherwise written independently.
